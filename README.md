# Wave Buoy Visualization

The goal of this project is to create an interactive visualization of current and historical ocean surface wave buoy data. The goal is for it to work for NDBC buoys first. 

The visualization is a Plotly Dash dashboard. The dashboard is to allow selections for:
- Buoy ID
- Time Period

The dashboard will display, depending on the data avialable:
- Time series of meteorological and integrated wave data (SWH, DPD, APD, MWD).
- Time-wave period evolution of spectral density.
- Time-direction evolution of spectral density.
- Time evolution visualization of directional spectral density.
